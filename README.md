# STDUTILS

## Yet Another Common Lisp Standard Utilities Library

This is my home grown standard utilities library on which langutils
and the registry projects depend so I've made it publically available.
I'm sure documentation would be helpful and if there is demand someday
I may generate auto-docs.
